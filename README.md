# Login

A simple login and registration page using LAMP.

## Usage

This project is intended to run on a LAMP stack.

The database connection settings starting with `$DATABASE_` can be configured in `register.php` and `authenticate.php`. The database variables need to be set to the same values in both. The login and registration system depends on being able to connect to the database. The PHP scripts will create any necessary databases and tables if they do not exist.
